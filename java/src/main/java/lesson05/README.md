# Lesson 5 - Using Existing Open Source Instrumentation

## Objectives

* Using Okhttp Open Source Instrumentation


### Walkthrough


### okhttp

Adding manual instrumentation to  okhttp like we did in [Lesson 3](../lesson03)
is tedious. Fortunately, we don't need to do that because that instrumentation itself already exists
as open source modules:

  * https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-okhttp

For an extra credit, try to use these modules to avoid instrumenting your code manually.
